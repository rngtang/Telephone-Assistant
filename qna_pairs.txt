      "answer": "The Innovation Co-Lab is a Duke Community resource for learning about, experimenting, and building with technology. We believe that Serious Play can lead to surprising results and inspiring outcomes, and we have built a program to encourage and support this mentality. This includes broadly accessible learning opportunities through our Roots Program and Office Hours, four campus Studios with open access to equipment and technology support, medical-caliber equipment and services supporting the most sophisticated clinical and research needs, and deep mentorship and support opportunities for prototyping your brilliant (or wild) ideas.\n\nAt the Innovation Co-Lab, we try to not only provide resources, mentorship, and support for student creativity with technology, but also build a community and environment that supports this kind of work. To that end, we have a living set of principles that help communicate that ethos:\n\nThe Co-Lab is for everyone at Duke, regardless of experience, field of study, background, race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, disability, or neurodivergence. Everyone can make things and creativity isn’t reserved for \"creative people\". Everything is an experiment. Play, flow, analyze, repeat. Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. Skills tend to transfer. Previous projects have a funny way of informing unrelated future work. The value of “Hello world” can't be understated – 3d printed trinkets often lead directly to published research. Ask a good question today. The work you do when you should be working is the work you should be doing. Duke is a special place with extraordinary resources. Use them all. There is great value in saying yes.",

If you are awarded funds for your project, you are responsible for keeping accurate transaction records and ensuring the project can remain financially viable, even if materials or equipment needs change as the project progresses (this is normal and totally OK!).

      "answer": "o DesignHub is a subsidized service provided to the Duke community by the Innovation Co-Lab. We will absorb the cost of labor up to a maximum of 20 hours. Beyond this consultation time, the service is cost recovery and you will be billed for time beyond the initial 20 hours as well as at-cost material charges for any materials necessary to fabricate the prototypes (if fabrication is part of the project). We try to scope our projects to stay well within the twenty hours of design and build time. Most projects will leverage 3D printing or other digital fabrication tools, and pricing for these tools can be viewed on the Bluesmith page.",
