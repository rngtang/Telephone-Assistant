This includes broadly accessible learning opportunities through our Roots Program and Office Hours, four campus Studios with open access to equipment and technology support, medical-caliber equipment and services supporting the most sophisticated clinical and research needs, and deep mentorship and support opportunities for prototyping your brilliant (or wild) ideas.\n\nAt the Innovation Co-Lab, we try to not only provide resources, mentorship, and support for student creativity with technology, but also build a community and environment that supports this kind of work. To that end, we have a living set of principles that help communicate that ethos:\n\nThe Co-Lab is for everyone at Duke, regardless of experience, field of study, background, race, gender, sexual orientation, ability, disability, or neurodivergence. Everyone can make things and creativity isn’t reserved for \"creative people\". Everything is an experiment. Play, flow, analyze, repeat. Don’t try to create and analyze at the same time. Skills tend to transfer. Previous projects have a funny way of informing unrelated future work. The value of “Hello world” can't be understated – 3d printed trinkets often lead directly to published research. Ask a good question today. The work you do when you should be working is the work you should be doing. Duke is a special place with extraordinary resources. Use them all. There is great value in saying yes.",

We'll set up a regular schedule to meet throughout the project timeline to overcome obstacles and celebrate successes.

      "answer": "Is there an application deadline?\n\nNo, applications are handled on a rolling basis throughout the year.\n\nWhat can I spend the grant funds on?\n\nMost of our grant funds are spent on materials, equipment, and components related to a project. This could include items like Arduinos, Raspberry Pi devices, wiring, electrical components in physical computing projects, raw materials like woods, metals, plastics, and hardware in more mechanical projects, and occasionally software or web resources in software projects.\n\nWhat can I NOT spend the grant funds on?\n\nThese funds are intended to be used on materials and supplies directly related to the completion of the project by the team. Grants may not be used to pay for stipends, housing, travel, consultants, contract labor, food, drink, or entertainment. Additionally, this program is intended for very early-stage prototyping and idea exploration, so in most cases we do not support funds explicitly intended for user acquisition, marketing, or growth of existing projects.\n\nHow are funds managed?\n\nIn addition to the fundamental learning experiences provided by the technology challenges of the project, this program is also designed to allow students to learn about project and team management, budget responsibility, and stakeholder reporting. If you are awarded funds for your project, you are responsible for keeping accurate transaction records and ensuring the project can remain financially viable, even if materials or equipment needs change as the project progresses (this is normal and totally OK!). Please also be aware that financial awards are taxable. Duke considers these awards to be income – please consult Employee Travel and Reimbursement for more information. For efforts associated with a club or student organization, fund code transfers are available and preferred.",
