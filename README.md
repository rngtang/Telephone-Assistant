# Co-Lab Telephone Assistant
Welcome to the Co-Lab's telephone assistant! This project is meant to serve as a conversational question-answering bot to which any student can ask questions about the Co-Lab, such as its facilities, tools, and workers. This project consists of two main parts:
1. Azure AI Speech: used for speech-to-text and text-to-speech interaction
2. OpenAI Assistants: used to generate answers to questions
